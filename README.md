# Countries-GDP-prediction

We have 'Countries of The World' data set 
(from kaggle: Fernando Lasso: https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world).

This dataset have each country as a data point (227 countries in total), and for each, we have 20 columns, each column represents a different aspect or measure of the specific country. 

The goal of the project is to understand this dataset, get some insights from it, and finally to train a model that can predict GDP per capita for each country.
